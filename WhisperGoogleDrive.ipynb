I mean, uh... Kai is Mr. Stool. So the Lenin and those. like especially the other side. He likes to see the moment, the including how they have radial symmetry. Like, yeah, I was on a film of academic, it was out in penta-radial symmetry. Anyway, the schnatz does a cross. LOCALLY T And. Hey! guide design this elbow, it's a symmetrical... elephant and the British students are always in there like, in their biometric, in something like... of the lip. and then some of the some achieved minds out. right So the star fusion is a penta-radial symmetry with values. Yeah. and I high shitted. I actually think it's a getter... Thio- I get the models for now for now insect Now, this is a crochet insect. relatively speaking. gross It says i Hey I say he is so felony. He's able to turn them on together. What was the last thing to me? the week! Yeah, I like all the insides essentially. kind of a shiny village out of it. We'll see. What's in? They said it might stand good. the cuticle, the moving the inside, the answer to Qadiyabir, no? Did you not know we used to have Reedmatch? How is this work out? No need to be a Jew, this people don't speak, they just think that why should Ole dynamic give us peace? The way they I will diminish this all the way again Like and thre- or muscles or relations or exoskeletons. that allows for ear to come in. and that's the goal, so go out. just nicely. So yeah, I'm signing like It's also in here with the cardboard. Goffin and zoom like models, goffin and zoom like actual... like Chai is again and again and again in Oushna. I came in my line, but didn't say it was good so it was good. You're not. and I feed a pig and I has it, it's young kids or I has it, or that, it's like the insides from the cars are like good. duh duh  and bleed there and done the the tissues, the organs. Then a guy similar to Andrew Oregon. So it's very interesting to compare and... comparative anatomy and physiology to compare what Who said the... Bye. the differences division in data inside. anxiety inside, they compare between different species. to be able to differentiate the tell. nice Yeah, no, this is the... It's biology, you know. now Sorry No linked above .

            "\n",
            "We've made clear the 12 traditions. Tonight I have asked Kelly to read them all. Go, Kelly. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Kelly, you're the public? Kelly. Kelly. If you're all the traditions, number one, our common operation from first to recovery depends on the AED. Two, for our new purpose, there's one more time to avoid. Looking at the obvious, and we express ourselves in our new conscience. Our leaders are the justice servants who do not govern in the community. The only requirement for AED membership is in the design of a soft paper. Four, each group should be autonomous, except in matters of any other groups for AED as a whole. Five, each group has but one primary purpose, to carry its message to the alcoholic who's no subject. Six, a main AED group of member and nurse, finance, or lending AED name to any related facility or outside enterprise. Rest problems and money property and rest of each, the burdens from our primary purpose. Seven, every AA group ought to be fully self-supported, planning outside contributions. Eight, our policy non-initiated should remain forever non-professional, but our service centers may employ special workers. Nine, AA as such ought never be organized, but we may create service boards or communities directly responsible to those they serve. Ten, our policy non-initus has no opinion on outside issues, hence the AA name ought never be drawn into public controversy. Eleven, our public relations policy is based upon attraction rather than promotion. We need always maintain personal anonymity at the level of press, radio, and events. And twelve, anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our traditions, from what I've ever reminded us to place principles in our country. Now, there is a man. Thank you. Now, let's give a warm welcome to our main speaker, Martin. Thanks. And welcome. Evening, hi, I'm Mark Houghton-Haulin. Good to be here, grateful to be here, grateful for another day of continuous sobriety. And my sobriety date is November 18th, 1984. Just yesterday, five years in November. And thank you, thank you, thank you. And I've had a great sense of my first meeting, so that's really spectacular. I wanna thank Randy for inviting me tonight. Thank you, Randy, and Scott, that was amazing. I mean, you were amazing up here, I was like watching an A-Rapper almost. I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, you got it, you got it, you got it, you got it. You got it, I got it, I got it. You got it, I got it, I got it. But it was an incredible story. And you know, it's quite, I just, I do generally know these books, I wanna read, I mean, like, I'll just put it down. There's a section that, that was Scott, something that took place for me, a little thing here. Since we've been speaking to you serious sometimes tragic things, this has been the family after the day of the day of the day. So we've been speaking to you serious sometimes tragic things, we've been dealing with alcohol in its worst aspect, but we are not, we aren't a glum lot. Then it goes on, it says, we think that cheerfulness and laughter make you useless. Outsiders are sometimes shocked when we first hit the merriment of a seemingly tragic experience out of the desk. I just laugh in our head off the huge float. And then it says here, we are sure God wants us to be happy, joyous and free. I used to be happy, Jewish and free, but I'm not kidding about that. I'm just kidding about that. I'm just kidding about that. I'm just kidding about that. I'm just kidding about that. I'm just kidding about that. I'm kidding about that. I'm just kidding about that. And we did not subscribe to the link that this life is a veil of tears. It once was just for many of us. So yeah, we are not a glum lot. When I first came to a, in the beginning, I used to, there was a lot of laughter. I'm gonna laugh during the talk. People told me, you know, that would be so funny. You know, this is a serious heart disease here. You know, you have to always think funny and mad and all that. I didn't listen to it. I'm sorry. But I kept coming. My thing was wine and beer. My thing was wine and beer. I had a short run with non-indicted marijuana. I spoke with Jordan. I gave him five years. ud That's how I spoke, so it was... outside the World Trade Center in 1976, we were coming to King Kong. at the World Trade Center in a key conversion and then look he was coming down the side of the World Trade Center. I hope to join. Our southern freind. and uh I end up in a hospital for half a joint. He was fine. My body was ready. Like, I was just. smoke and I would just... out Thank you. and they struck me down and they gave me scores, you know, in the first three days. So it was a lot. And I said that's it in the morning, Robert. I hope you'll take my time. and then I started drinking and uh... I'm not your child. I grew up in New York. My parents didn't have drink. When my parents got married in 1951, in those days, I didn't have to do any work. They would give people, like, bottles of whiskey as they ate away from you, and they'd drink them. I was like 12, 13, so I started breaking into those bottles and drank them. And my parents, it was always, you know, it was always out of me, you know. People always thought there was something wrong with me. Ever since I was a little kid, my parents would sit me down and say, Mark, what's wrong with you? You know there's something wrong with you. We're not sure what it is, but we know there's definitely something wrong with you. We make faces all the time. He's mumbling. You know, looking at anybody, you don't answer any questions. What's going on? They would shrink my head. What's going on in that little head of yours? Answer us. Answer us. You know, be your friends. We're trying to help you, you know. And I had this everywhere I went, you know. I went to school. I had a teacher, you know, sometimes they would keep me, you know, I had a good question go out, you know, Mark, what's wrong with you? What's going on with you? You're out in the window all day, and I'm on the phone, and I don't know if you want to do anything I asked you to do. You remember one time in the fifth grade, the fifth grade teacher, Mrs. Golden, and then she brought me hell. She, you know, when I was growing up in New York, you wanted to be a New York school teacher. It was required that you had to hate children. I can hate them. But Mrs. Golden, I was miserable in class. I was troubled. But one time she called me up to find a new class. She said, Mark, I wanted you to come up to this fifth grade. She goes, I wanted you to come up to find a new class. I wanted the class to see exactly what an angel looks like. She's talking to you, she's standing there, she's everybody can see it, and I need you to come. She's coming for it. She goes, hey, hey, you don't want to, whatever you guys told me to do. And you know what I did? I said, everyone. And she said, let me sit down. You know, I went to the point of class in school where basically the teachers gave off, I was done in the school in third grade. I had mentally checked out. I don't know how I learned to read and write, which I did. I learned math. But after that I checked out. And the teachers eventually said, okay, this is the deal, Mark. This is what I wanted you to do. When you come to class, just sit in the back, hold your hands. You don't have to do anything. You don't have to read anything. You don't have to do any reports, take any tests. I just did a zero at the end of the year. And I said, okay. And that's what happened. I got the worst report cards. I mean, I still have some of that on. Big reds and you go all over the place. So that's what I did. That's when I went to school and I felt very, not a part of anything red-bodied there. You know, I was in school in sports and we'd play. I always wondered about him. So he would choose up sides. I'd be like the other one standing there. I wonder who that is. Who wants him? And so I would take him on the side of a young left field. So it just seems kind of rough. I was also a very annoying child. That's how I got my attention. It was very annoying. And people would say to me, you know, Mark, you are the most annoying person I've ever met. I've never managed to have more money than you do. You live to a normal day for the second job. You get a thrill out of ruining my day. Does that make you happy to ruin my day? You get a kick out of that. And you can start a thing, yeah? I don't know. And I would do things like, you know, I would wait for buses. I would go to New York. I would bus open the other day. The bus driver would open the door. I wouldn't get on. I would just stand there and go, are you going to get on? I'd just stare at him. If you get in line, you're not getting on. I'd stare at him. Close the door. And across the traffic, I could run and beat him to the next stop. So I'm not going to open the door. I'll stand there again. I just love being like, what's wrong with you? What's wrong with you? You have to be an army-held bus driver, right? Tough day. I just enjoy talking water balloons out the window. Are people going to work? And they get all nice and messy for every occasion. And I love the ad they say, rough the building. How can I pay for things to do to the right people? I used to like to throw a ash can of sherry pomps out the window at Forte Mountain. And I was in New York, living in a little apartment complex in Stroud. I had the buildings. I'd go in the bathroom. We had one bedroom apartment with one bathroom. And I'd go to the bathroom window. And I'd like cherry poms. And it's throwing out the window at like 4 in the morning. I'd sort of wake up the entire day late. And then one time, I actually lit this cherry bomb. And I threw it like a window. And it comes back into the attic. I was standing there. And it just exploded. And the whole bedtub, the black rooms, and all of it was going to school. My parents said the house blew up. And the man in the bedroom, I'm like, I don't know if you can fill up or something. And you're just eating like, you know, a little underwear, just smoke all around. The tub just burped. And he said, what happened? And I said, I don't know. I don't know. I'm just just standing there. It's a little disclosure. I don't know. What's wrong with you? Mo seems up at 4 in the morning. I'm asleep. I'm not doing up to school in the morning. Um... Around 14, I think around 14, I really have my first. I usually pretend I was drinking before I start drinking. I would... I can't believe we used to look at the bad virus. What's the matter with coming to a bar? each side of the gold point down. Yeah. Feel the God. And I would do that with a co-pilot, a shockless co-pilot, or a make-weave to a support tender. That was just... is where the 2022 female and get angry. I'm going to see how close you guys are. We're going to be back in a few seconds. And I used to pretend I was drunk before I started drinking. I was just like stung around the house. going to a wall, you know, roll off the bed. And I was just, how was he drinking? I was just dead, I was drunk. So at 14, Jimmy had a bottle. Jack Dan was a Southern Comfort, I don't remember, and he cracked it open, and behind a building somewhere, he got this stuff, and then I started on the roof, you know? You know, and I started drinking the stuff. Never left the hard stuff, never left it, didn't make any sense to me, just didn't like the taste. And then I started going to beer, and I started drinking, and you know, they talk about the, you know, what do you call it, the piers, you know, like the roller companions. So, you know, none of the kids, the smart kids in school who want to hang out with me for, you know, good reasons. In fact, the kids I started hanging out with, two in particular, one guy, David, and this guy, Ricky, this is before we were doing any drugs or any stuff, these were my two best friends, and they weren't even drinking it, nothing, but I picked two guys so enough to become alcoholics and heroin addicts. Just these type of people, I was frozen. And I really died at 20, 223 is, he says, his wedding. On his wedding night, he looked at LSC with his wife. The Tagos get in and they slow on another couple so you know this marriage is gonna last. And uh... He was down dead in a chair sitting up. He'd been there two or three days. Bridget Morris had said he had a break his back again when he talked to the other person. So he's gone. I truly love the guy. He was one of my dear friends. And, you know, I used to talk him into, I used to gamble too. I used to, I learned math at the race track group. I learned to cut out of school and put athlete up to Belmont. And, uh, we had the total number of fractions and multiplication. I was really quick. And I used to get him to take money from his drunk father. And I had, you know, $20, $46. And then we'd go to the traffic club. He would come home drunk with his big roll of money. And he'd snap something and then he would split it with me when we rode the race track. So he started my other friend David. Um, I just visited the other day. He's, uh, my oldest little new friend. He's, uh, he's in a, uh, hospice now. He's got, uh, lung cancer. And he's, won't say, uh, carbon monorrhoids. So, you know, he's, he's mad. And, uh, which is fine with me. He can do whatever he wants. He wants cigarettes. He has to be violent. I'll buy him cigarettes. I have no charge for him. You know, he can look out his life any way he wants. But, uh, what happened was he told me this story was incredible. And nothing to do with me. But, uh, he was homeless and living, um, he was living in a flat hotel down on, uh, probably downtown in LA. This is, like, really cheap hotel with old tatters and just killed people and all that. And then one night he, uh, um, performed. So he kind of told me to come on the soft show. And, uh, he was like, I can't believe it. I can't believe he was on the, you know, he always said he wanted to get a comedian. And there he is on his show. And, uh, he said, I gotta do something about that. I gave him myself together, you know. And he didn't do it right away. And then, uh, one night he was sitting in the bushes outside the Communist Market and he had a radio. And I came on a talk show. And he heard me. He goes, uh, okay. And he actually took one of the meetings and got something, you know. And I had nothing to do with me. But, uh, it was an amazing thing that he told me this, that, uh, you know, and I had been sober a number of years at that point, too. It was really, uh, pretty cool. But anyway, he's one of my little, cute friends. And I met a businessman and he did whatever he wants and, uh, just loved the guy. So anyway, I started drinking. I started with the, uh, Lord companions. And, uh, I'm a Jewish kid. And I started hanging out with the Irish kids. And, uh, they drank a lot of beer and stuff. And, uh, they weren't fond of the Jewish people. And they would see me and they'd go, here comes the Jew. And, uh, I took it. You know. I hate you, I hate you, I'm good. Give some beer. And, uh, I took it. You know, I, I sunk, I sunk in that, in that group. You know what I mean? I mean, it just felt like, you know, I'm not holding anything, you know, similar to all that. But that's, that's, I didn't belong there. And that's the only people that I wanted to be with, you know. So anyway, I came out drinking. I was 16. I knew there was something wrong, and I knew I had issues. And I decided to go to the derivative. On my own. At 16. And, uh, a lot of kids don't do that at 16, but I did. And, uh, I paper myself, even though they had the slime, I decided to scale it, you know. I had no job at all. I had no plans at all. I was getting a job. No plans were working. I didn't want them to work. The whole idea of work, giving me the shivers. And to see my father go to work in the morning. I had four or five in the morning. And he didn't actually go out of the way. I don't know. So, uh, starting on the therapist, and then at 16. I was in there every 17 years. Pretty much got 17, 16 years before I got to AA. And I would occasionally drink with some of my therapists. Like, I would have, like, a psychological breakthrough. Like, from one time I told my therapist, I told my parents to drop dead. He goes, yeah. You know. 50 years. Sit up yourself, you know. And, uh, take out a little lime toast. Um, it was helpful to send somebody to talk to once a week. Once or twice a week. Otherwise, I didn't know anybody thought. But I was turning into a mom where I, even at a young age, 18, I was wondering, what kind of breakfast is this? You know. 18, 12 years old, you know. 70 year old guy with a paper bag on his head. And I was like, right, it sucks. 90 years old. It sucks. I'm getting robbed here. And I was like, the attitude I had, you know. That's why people tell me, I don't like your attitude. I don't like your attitude. I didn't have to fight for a job. I remember this guy called me, and the boss called me, and he said, you know, you do get shot for a job. You're so depressing that you're around. I'm so glad that nobody else can see you in an interval. You know, you're always moping around and... I'm not letting you go because she's personal. I'm not letting you go because she's personal. Yes, OK. And as I jump once I remember I worked at a place at a barber's shows It's been 15 hours. and it was done. What do you got to read? Mr. $80 and then he took out taxes and then he took out the union, then I had to buy a uniform, then I had to pay for transportation and buy a lunch, I paid $3 off to get a new eat. I remember my first check I started crying. Ha ha ha. So, I started to use therapists, you know, and I never mentioned how to die a drink or some drugs, I never mentioned any of this stuff. And this one therapist, one of my problems in life is I don't know anybody liked it. I don't know anybody liked it. Anything liked it, you know? So I said to this director, I'm feeling that he didn't like me. And I said, I have a question for you. Do you hate me? And he goes to me and goes, I don't want to get into it. I'm a good dude. I'm a good dude. I don't want to. I'm a good dude. I said, I'll tell you the truth. Just be honest. Do you hate me? He goes, tell you the truth, I hate you. I hate you. I'm really angry. You're a witch. I'm annoying. You ask for it. I don't know about that. So I said, I didn't want to do it. It was $2 in session. I said, you know, I'm not paying you $2 this. I'm not even salty like that. I'm paying you $2. And he turned the fight into dessert. So I was like, you're so, anyway, I left there. And I was, you know, I was derpy. And I was a dark mrs. Woman and just in my heart Anyway, I get my brain in New York Well... Mooing You can drink on the streets there, you know, and then drive. You know, you have the subways, the buses, the cab. So you drink on the streets, I would go through a therapy session and stop their boat day getting on a little grocery store, and they put a beer in the bag, a little paper bagging, and nothing looks more like a beer in the bag than a beer in the bag. Everyone sees you go, it is a beer. You just poke it a little paper bag. You know, it doesn't look any good on the side of the bag. So they put it in there, and I'm going to drink after the session, which is right there in my mind. So again, I wasn't interested in working, but I was interested in performing and stuff like that, and I had to figure out a way to support myself, so I worked on my, you know, performing, but I had to get a regular job. And my friend and I, we got in a department in New York, this three-bedroom department was very cheap at the time, it was just in the late 70s, it was $350 a month for a three-bedroom department in Manhattan. And we got a third roommate and we charged him $300. He knows the rest for five years. So my rent was $25, and what I used to do for money because I didn't want to work, I would go to the coffee house in the village, the branch village, and I was bringing up, I had a big bottle, one of those five-gallon water bottles, I thought it would change, and I put some on the table. I had this little cafe, and I had a note that said, if you need some money, take some if not, use something for those to do. It was a great time. And people would say, oh, really, I just want to say help yourself. And they'd go, just doing that, and they'd just kind of make me wait $10 an hour. And I didn't say it was for charity, I just put a thing up, you know. I wasn't lying to that, whether it was for us, or whether it was for my eyes, I just didn't think of that. So I ended up working, and I did my roommate with the app, and I did five years of doing another roommate, and made a whole group of 15. So I got that pay rent, it was a beautiful thing. So anyway, I eventually, in New York, I moved to LA in 1984, I figured I'd move out here, and I got an apartment on a question mark, so I was earning some money in my career, a little bit of money there, and then I'd have to pay some rent, and do stuff like that, moved out of LA, and here they drive, and that made a difference. At the end, I hit up a car in New York, and I know it's quite a corolla, but you don't really drive in New York, you just look for parking spaces. You say Thursday, and you immediately move it over to Monday and Friday. I had the car for years, and I had like 12 miles on it, and one side of the street and the other, you know, I never drove the car. But when I moved to LA, I was driving drunk, I was drinking in the club, drinking. I knew it was just a matter of time, until I killed somebody, killed myself, got an accident, and nothing, frankly, more than prison. The idea, I'd cross the corner, and even in an elevator, I don't get an elevator without gum or water to this day, in case I get stuck in there. I get in, I do everything I have to do, but I still know he's got it. So I got out of LA, and I need some help. So first my friend sent me to this therapist, my friend Tom, he was seeing this guy, it was $100 an hour, and he said, let's see this guy, the first session is free. Like a drug dealer, you know, let's say, let's see this guy. And about 20 minutes into the session, he starts waving his hand right at the crease, and he goes, stop talking, stop, stop talking right now. I want you to know the word. So that's the one thing I need to do, I can't help you. I can't help you at all. I said, well, do you know anybody that can? He goes, no help here. Do you know anybody? I can't help you sleep in my office right now. Go away, I want to see you. Goodbye. I don't remember saying anything like really nutty, like, you know, I'm going to go outside my room, I'm going to the trunk of the car, and I'm going to have a relationship problems in life, friendship, depression, you know, there's nothing present. Anyway, he called me, this guy called me about 20 minutes, a half hour later, and he said, he was like two hours later, he called me, and he said, listen, I have to apologize. It's something you said, I don't know whether this guy snapped. He said, he said something, I want nuts. And he said, you want to come back? I said, are you kidding me? I said, no, I was getting him. And then I went to see a doctor of interest who... His wife was embarrassed. I'm gonna show you. is a therapist. and I was sort of going... Thank you so much. in the first session she goes, why are you here? So I just said, uh... What about I said, you know, I think I freaked you up. And she said... I didn't have a hole. And nobody would ever ask me if I was somebody. I never came up, I never came up. I never got caught, I never went through a mental, I never went through a P-clap stomach. She goes, all right, you know, and I was in this little chair that you spin around it. I was just in and I just... Oh god, I just went around it. I'm back for a go. Um... And without knowing what I just... I just took the first step about personal. I knew I came out of the program, I knew nothing, but I didn't. It says it's a good job. You can see to your innermost self. I'm gonna hit. I knew in every part of my body, everything, I was not followed. And I said I am, she goes, it's very great of you to say that. Okay, this is the deal. She goes, I cannot help you unless you go to AA first. Cannot come back here unless you go to the meeting. If you go to the meeting, then you come back, if not, say hello to me. I'm thinking, hey, this morning was like seven o'clock an hour. I don't want my money. I said, where are the meetings? She goes, look at yourself. She goes, that's a bit. You're not thinking. That's a great thing to do. So I said, okay. And I got home, and I called AA. I got the phone number, so now I'm an operator. And I got this guy on the phone, and this was on that Thursday. And I couldn't go until Sunday. And he said, do you think you cannot join until you go on Sunday? And I said, yeah, I'll try. And I just hadn't had one yet. And he said, okay, don't drink Sunday. And I started with Troy. I had the details. I had the, uh, the weird interpreters. I had to voice it, I heard sounds, say the whole thing, started acting. Never knew I had that stuff. I never had it before, but I never started drinking a lot of my food. So I stopped and then I sweated down and went through it, I shook it out, I shook it and I banged my teeth together. I really want to do it together but I'm very glad that I had that experience. I'll never forget that experience. Anyway, brothers, he sent me this reading of Fairfax and Fountain, the gay man's name. Let men shake about homosexuality and discuss the topic. He started sending this meeting, so I go to this man's meeting, and up the stairs, beautiful little church on the corner there, and there's four pipes there. This little thing you go through to get into the room, and I'm looking, and it's like 100, 200 guys in there, and everybody got crewed cuddles and smiling and laughing and having a drink. And this one guy looks at me across the room, just looks and I look at him, and he starts coming forward. And this one is like the tiniest guy in the ever seen. He had a little, um, far belt with a pink feather, and little pink shorts and a mirror in him. He didn't look like he was walking close, he played his ice games. He looked graceful, he looked nice. And he goes, This comes up to me and goes, are you new? And the guy says, yeah, I am. And he goes, I'm responsible. And he said that, because I'm responsible. And I didn't know what it was. And I'm not going to see a word about it. So I think he made it the time, Thursday, and told him, and told him I was coming. And he'd be on the lookout for young babies. So he would get an order. So he goes, I'm responsible, and he takes me to the room. And he puts on a ride and starts introducing me. And I'm like, no, I'm out of it. He starts introducing me. Everybody seemed to have a name Tom. This is Tom Jay, Tom L, Tom B. And I was like, 15, and crewed cuddles smiling and happy to see me. Catch me coffee and. because we have been interesting this idea. No, I'm free! It's over! No more! No matter what! Why does this guy show up second? He's never met me before. I looked at him and I said, okay! I've never had another drink. Thank you. Thank you. I'm going to drink right out of it. And, uh, he gave his golden words, like, the lady at the birthday party that he came up here, I think it was 25 years, and she said, no matter what, she said it. That's what you should be no matter what. there. My first year as a writer, when I get everywhere I went, I go, What?  everywhere, looking around. I sit away from the wine, sir. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Do anyone ever come back ? Wow. And... I just kept coming and I fell in love with the program. I'm more in love with it. You're absolutely right of this program. So I can't count the videos in that. I love this story, Chief. You know, we read the book like your story. Yeah. Oh! 40! Nicholas thought that too. You know. I'm going to take the apple. I can't listen to some of these stories. I mean. It's incredible. I am. and most famous stories. Um... We drink coffee and- Eat cookie dough. I've never seen anything like this. I've never seen this one before. It's up on the podium. It's already done. It's that feature, I hope that we will murder it. I'm thinking, I got a good program. So hungry now. So, I had two people say, did you get anything? I had two people say, did you get anything? I had two people say, did you get anything? So we've done these stories since several times before the last era of the movie. Why so? The Skis Sessions Induct.. So anyway, I kept coming. and uh You know, this book, this is my original big book. I think I got responds to Tom Davis to me. And I also have the date here. 2000? 1980 Peter I've been... I don't like my... Stay true. COL Ziggy  10 minutes and I start writing and I did the fifth step. and uh Um... That made me feel officially on the program, and in the program. Before that. She's a problem for me in the past, I didn't do a work. and you're still ready to do the work. I feel the shame, I feel the part of it. I just gave up. I just knew that when I came here. if I didn't do this work. and the idea. just until the new year. So I did the work, I did the four, they did the fifth. and um The guy seems never in issue with me. I always sleep in the other room. Never in issue. Um... Even as a local, I would sit in rooms. I really chose. I'm just anNew Temporary builder.  I was screaming in the house and I was- Harvey Hard usage  We hear it in a little bit. And I would always talk to you about it, I mean I'm just great. I will. Um... Excellent, I'd really like to see hisyllic Monday, to a temple, back to my synagogue, you know, and I remember regularly there. So I put my list with that and she goes out in the book. Um... He says he's going to do it as soon as he's doing a good step. Do the six and seven immediately. It doesn't say you ain't gonna hear it. You do it immediately. The same day, you just go and do it. And Bill Wilson himself, a couple guys, a 16-7 person, somewhere, you know, he's... to remember him and say. . I don't want to use the same word hope. I dedicate the night. You men! I never had an issue with having revenge on me. people so Braciously. helping my parents. Even though I was at the Hawke compact, I told them they had set them down and said... together. over. So everyone, thank you for the time. Thank you, Dr. Loke. And... and so he gets over it. because he didn't know. So, That was... That was fantastic. I um... I don't think I have been watching I love you, my friend. I have seven minutes. Yeah, okay, so. Okay, so I remember one time I had a program where it's interesting. There's a place called 47 Street, over in New York. Okay, everything bossing people with their bag, and doing something such an interesting thing, which could at least, you know words just like... and is nothing. You can recruit, you say. So we're not just all about being friends. We're just all about being with somebody, and being in groups outside and dealing with something like... Iniy's Ba Arabade, that Association of Women Women was absolutely great and really abstract and topple into classy and and it was run by them and I went in to buy something. and remembering At 10 years early, I had stolen 10 moles of help from the police. Okay. So, am I going to pay a change? I was just thinking in the head. I said, I'll put 10 more rows of film on the... my bill. He said, how does it come? He said, well, I'm on a spiritual. Good question. Thank you. And I... I'm so honored for you, I need to pay you back. So he goes up. Okay hang on one second I gotta talk to somebody. You gotta be a big old kid with a hat. You gotta be a big old hat. We discussed the issue. In fact, maybe this is the deal. In fact, we had to give you the price from 10 years ago. because we charge you today's price and we're robbing you. So the whole thing... I want to do my thing. He knew exactly what he had to do. That was worked out pretty much for me. I'm going to look on another story mark, something that just happened this week. Um... So anyway, there was a band program eight years ago and... I'll give up his name, so. His name is not Becky, but his name is Becky. Yeah. I didn't even know. So he was a friend of mine and I was sober and I was sober. He was a great guy, a tremendous guy. funny guy. fish smoke though, I'm not contenting around it. June Birth worthless So, just pressernium upon the Thank you. Thank you. and for a friend who's like, oh, you're a big time in there. I felt protected. to a little guy in a year. from this anyway. I had a partner in New York that kept you in my friend, Lieutenant. I let him stay there. certain amount of time. A lot of people stay free. So I have this one guy, you see.  They called me up and said I thought there was a TV and a radio and stereo here and I'm here. I said, really? So I put my print back here and I got into a new store and everything like that. Okay. So So, I need to leave you alone, so I'll just go to the paper. So he stole his stuff. I said, for real, you're good. That's where you got it. But they still have it. I was going to sell it for the world. Oh, I'm gonna pass it. I'm just gonna throw it back. I'm gonna throw it back. question. I just smell. Okay. So I travel for business and I went to Indianapolis. And while I was in Indianapolis, I met this guy, this jeweler. And, um... I told them November 18, we're talking French. I told them November 18, 1984. Which... It's been important to have you announce my sobriety birthday. And he's true, and he said, you know. I'd like to make you a ring. And we decided that yay tribal with unity and serenity and... You're beautiful, and I wore it every day, I wish it weren't ready. One time I looked at like a gratitude, I felt happy to see it, reminding myself of my view. So anyway, any, uh, uh, maybe... I still don't know what it is. He moved to LA and he needs to go to the state for a little while before I see him. He's going to go to a private place and I see him and say it with me. So when he leaves, he's on my room, he's talking. beautiful ring that I really love to shrink, you know? And I asked him, he never talked to me, never said he took it. But then I was hearing more stories about it, just stealing it from other people.  I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. And they tried to call me over the years like this. No. Yeah. I forgive him. I don't hang apples around with you with them. So anyway, uh... A month ago. And I never replaced that ring. I never bought another one. I never did. I just said. times. So about a month ago... This is a house where survivors named Roman. He's on a program, he's about 90 years old now, he came over here, he was in the camps. They came over and became a Jeweller. in the United States. and I told him, you know, Roman, it was my birthday. November 18, 35 years in writing, he goes... I'm gonna make you a ring. and uh It's okay. I need more strength, okay? Let me figure out exactly what it is. and This week in strength. It's almost an exact replica of the ring that was stolen and it was found. So this is a cable circuit. and it was an amazing thing, I had nothing to do with it. but I think my eye always drew that I missed the screen. I wanted an antiloxamine and my 35th birthday. I'm going to get district. So. Let's have a look. You know, I keep showing up. I'll try to automate it if I can. I can't get it in my shoulder, I can't get it in my shoulder.

            "         Okay.  started. So. This is the last chapter. Um... So the final call to electu... We have. like on. different. Remember when I... equivalent. Thank you. I just hadn't had any. experience. everyone... learn. So. How I usually. Start with something. Wow.  would know. balance. In problems.  So, and for some reason... still hard. with no idyllic And the reason I had that was I... gonna happen. know that do that. you one which is were wrecked. For now we're gonna do it. under.  balance. network.   So. readable. that gonna have reaction.  drive a whole day. the same way you do in your... And those are the things that. So How much energy. you're getting. and then hold. Millie. The conditions. little bit. been doing And then. gonna look How? Okay.  Thank you. A. That's how this. chapter is going to go. down to about 100. Why? Goodnight. Generally, they're always... based on it. of the about this. fine goes. But how would it? I don't like... out later. short you bases. and the other thing. I'm in it. Make sure... Make sure that you're aware of it. all the individual things that are more relevant. I'm gonna move you. I like. show you what are. things but I'm going to show you what I think is the easiest means that... If I do... you mentioned some I'm gonna make you dirty. clear I don't like This method works. Here's how I like to think about it. not the method you're going to.   be like. different I'm religious. You know what I... One where you don't necessarily.  information. and you don't have to just. put it in. but when you just think about it and you easily and all of that will be. So for today, we're actually. going to really be talking about Alice. and the new component of that will... There will be a couple of. on how you also. .. then we'll get into. and I'm going to have. Oh. So that's what we're talking about here. babies. And these are all these things. through here or signing up. numbers. all stuff you already know. riding efficiency as far like that would work. Then we'll get into these. So. of the Spirit that I would urge to do. And then what if you had to live the Jewish life from your mom to your many moment. Because she's children potentials. redo. when we do get it. So I'm gonna... I'm gonna mix. you're aware that There were also lots of data in there. you to know. chemical cell. Usually it. Can you actually? in for What did it? briefly at the end. Okay, so I'll break all of this down. We'll get into cells. Um. I'm hoping to get through this. relevant. Turn around. Stop me, don't. you  I know it's a review. Oh. while back. release  So... Generally remove... through relatively fast. If you need me to slow down, let.  and then you're like, oh no. me know So, read out the reactions. reduction reaction That's what we're referencing. on You know, we looked at. the last. chapter we're looking at is 5A. So we're looking at whether or not either physical processes are chemical reactions are. spontaneous. and we saw that based on the. universe. on. translated to Delta G being negative. which is how we... Now. when we look at chemical reactant. and we're looking at. relatively reach out to me. time up. for the five that you learned in World War. from a single replacement. in composition synthesis. Goodbye. The only one that wasn't uh We got. was the double replacement. and What that meant? when we said redox was here, we said... print. of life. hugely important. whole point of support. The whole point of this chapter is Electrons will be in trans... and then we want to see if the electrons are being transferred in a Indonesia's... in mysterious Mic life. process. that we can generate. energy why we. one day. So here we're really only talking about redox. D S These are things every day. one. React Um... When you have a redox When I say you have a... That means one thing is heads free to loc Something else must be in. just to recall that it's not like He just. transfer to nowhere. Lewis has. Right. something had passed. go somewhere. something's taking something. You give up and elect. or elect. run. then You are... See you in the final subject line, then consider... If you ex... those elects. than you are reduced. You're looking in the chemical reaction from the. React inside. to the products.  So you look at. the reactant side and you say. What is this? V. charged. on. in all of the reactants. What is the charge on?  project. And then. What happened? from one thing to another. It either has the same charge. 0 0 plus 1 plus 1 whatever or there's some change from plus one to zero. And then you say, well, that thing then lost. or gained an electron depending on what it is. And that thing now from the reactive side was either reduced or oxidized. in order to become the... all. is the reference. looking at reacted product. So. Here we go. important. This is your expectation. on use those things like. oil rig I think we use.  The other lion. Right? Leo the lion. big roar. I don't know if I can... fuckin. So there's a deep, once again. review here. as I mentioned. I just want to make sure you're all onboarded. jumping into. trying to solve. So here's an example of. This would be a synthesis. would be it on. And I look over here and I say, well, this is in its elemental. charges zero. This is in its elemental.  charge is zero. Over here in the compound, the magnesium is... 2 plus in the sulfur is a... It's a very simple reaction. Then I say magnesium went from zero to two. That means it lost.  So it was oxidized. The sulfur went from 0 to 2 minus So we gain the same tool like. theAAA It was.   now If this was oxidized, it's... That means this was So I'm saying the magnesium has oxidized the... sofas reduce that. by what I see on the right. In other words, I'm not saying the magnesium. plus design. product. of the octane. presentation. Now, exactly. So the one that was oxidized... It. cause the reduction. So it's called the reducing agent. Once again, the react inside of our... This was reduced. So it's the oxidizing. the That's a  becomeurtism. These are plus electrons Mosses Teddy No eyes. Use these pm? You lose his electrons? gains electrons. these producing agent. The total number of electrons.  to win this. electrons are Now I can write these in half.  more clearly with Um. So here's the ax. magnesium. with separated and forms magnesium 2 plus ions. the the the and the reduction in the sulfur. taking up those two electrons. in general. You can. start with half react. ultimately, and I'm gonna start. year. in order to. take these and combine it into this. which is generally what you do with half reactions that are hard to balance. You have to have the elect... on both sides. That is the. ultimate goal in. balancing. What we did. That's where people. So y'all just have to know that. whole enough cancel it. down.  Hope we're good. How is this okay? So this all basic review? which is what I want. through here. Haha. Now the other thing is But we called these things when I looked up here. Good night, good night. didn't do here. Remember I said this is a zero, that's a zero, that's a two plus and a... minus Those are called oxidation numbers or oxidations. And that's how you first have to evaluate. them a career. in order to figure out what was reduced. That's the only way you can do it. because once again you're looking at the.  where they are. how many are being.    So here's. Oh. Just gonna show you, yeah. Close daylight? I told you this.  show you or whoever you. 101 with. The first couple of things here.  Um. Oxidation number of an atom in a free element, in other words, in its elementals. say distributed sew Lorenz'sTenord MNou That's what it is. inhibition. including the oxygen. diatomic, those are also zero. each individual one. Oxidation number of a monatomic ion is equal to its... That's it. sodium plus one. of one. beacon These are things you've already. No, no, no, I'll obtain this. When you have a chemical reaction, you have just sodium. charge is zero. if you had sodium. It's a plus one. then Georgia. Um... if you have Let's say I do this. charge on this sodium is zero. The charge on this is plus one. Now I'll follow you. Does that help? Kelly Thomas. We talk about mango atomic. confusing one. H Kil y\". So let me show you one with the... Let me show you this one. So bye. Thank you. I'm not dying, I'm not going to die. poly Anna Yeah, yeah, policy would be the same thing, but it would... to it. So if I just draw a a little bit structured here. Basically I have here it was So. 7. 7. 7. Even the Aren additional charges. there is A ST ON in way The overall. Are you not Solving stupid? Given the overall terms, this is your...  plus one and two minus. These are both. zero. So if I draw, if I add on. another CL or join here. Ryan.  phosphorus. But here. I hear them. one of those One day, one day. I am. I am. with this Those are like... DELG the secretary is something  in a belly coming out. I'm here to do.   The extra one is the nickname.  Okay. No. So these first ones, these are all things you know. manner I do say the diatomic. or It's... just suggest. poly-tom Mayer or as eat whatever. Those are also each. individual one would just be zero. cl2 each YLZ Those should be up. now. These are also. some of the oxidation number of... all atoms in a neutral or... formulas zero. and ion is equal to... to the ion that... zero. One, two, three, these are all. Same thing here. In the compound, metal will have a positive. Oh.  One. One group. to once again. Here's where the new thing... and The recent for this. here is because in born woman eh20ork do What you have is you have just like we looked at the head. the hydroxide. You have... things that. You're going to... Zoom. based on the let fronting. activities. We're the elect...  favoring you're gonna just provide. that. particular thing with the election. for example. Thank you all. so you can... say here. and Generally... This is one. one So everything works out as. 0 0 Now you can also then... day. these. here. to electrons. The two electrons in this part of the two elect... Which one has a greater electron negative? one social the ox. to do this later. electro negativity. So these two electrons are actually. going to be closer to the ox. to Jim. than the hydrogen. but they're shared. These are now. here. on e. believe they're not I am. But what we are going to say is be because they're unhea- very here. Bingen has it. closer. to them. is going to. them. there as part of. And you, For example. I have. too. feel. Hey. around the oxygen. I have... normally six which means the oxygen is now a 2- in here. and each hydrogen would be a... one. because their electrons that they came in ... closer to the oxygen. which leaves them with zero electrons. and therefore a plus one charge. and the oxygen now takes those... too.  Trons. and is now considered a 2 minus. So all we did was we were making these. almost like what you would ex if it was an ionic. fun. but it's really a covalent. or covalent bond. and the polar covalent. Bonding The electrons are just assigned to the thing that's more electron negative. And now we could say. that in the H2O the oxygens of 2- Each hydrogen is a plus one. And that. This thing is really setting you up. whenever you have the in it. covalent compound, it's always minus one. Doesn't matter what it's Next on the list is Hydrogen Dethosum. plus one. Oxygen's always a minus. to unless it's with. BORING! That will now change what I... because   means that a bond between a bond and a bond is a bond. will read it off.  They're going to be closer to the. . than the oxygen. is going to get it, which makes... oxygen that way. positive. So let me. show you. I mean   Here's where the electrodes are actually. green. or the octogen. red here or the hydrogen.  Oxygen has a greater electron negativity than the hydrogen. which means that... This. electron and that electron.  move. in general. Yeah. Remember they're on the. So that means that here I can assign each. age. is a plus. and the oxygen now is a... 2 minus because it has... to actual ... Roll out. But here... The fluorine has a greater electron negative. tub. of the election. that are coming from the oxygen. are gonna be closer to the. in this box. So now the oxygen in this case... Is a two plus! because they gave up those two elects. in this. and the chlorine is gonna be... But the one with greater electron negativity is going to have a greater. So it's... Not that they're completely. not completely. Not an ionic. But it's on e the chairing of the elect.  and the one that pulls it closer. the one we're going to assign where the electron actually... presumably transfer. to give it a turn. but there is one. but it is. enough to make it a guy. I'm not talking about the magnitude of it. simply saying that. moment occurred. and it occurs because you have unequal sharing. because the flooring has a greater hold up. Remember at any given time These are still shared and one of these could be closer to that. guy substitute This is not like... Just a way to assign where you would... the electrons. the bees. most of the time. It's not a real physical. And that's where you get. That's why this is So when you read this, this is whatever's on top. always Please press. of everything below. So if I have fluorine in there, it's always a minus one. Hydrogen's always a plus one. to minus two unless I have flooring. then the oxygen is used. She changes to a two-pot. will get the money. what automatic because of the like... If you know you. It doesn't b- Why but that Why? cow m We will display, And then you go all the way down these. So basically you follow one, two, three, four, five, and when you get to five, you follow this. in order to assign whatever route. Ok, Ludner, uh, enters in like intranetic oxidation state or number within the state. So that's... theBY by  setup. Once again. not valid. This doesn't actually trans... not But if I assign it that way, I... always know. what was given or what was. Thank you. allow me Okay, so let's just take a look here for. So this says determine the oxidation.  chlorine in the following compound. chlorine in the first. What is it in the... ,- Oxygen gonna always be what  Hydrogen's always gonna be wet.  So what must. So, you know. so you're remember that scheme is always 2 minus This is always. plus one that doesn't interfere. that means is has because the overall thing is So what about this? or plus. tw So let me just rather. a couple of... So the first one, this is the first one's easy, right? h is always plus one, which means this Cl is minus one. based on that lift. The second one. It just... Do plus one. Oxygen. 2 minus. So the chlorine must. you Does that help? little bit. Now here's the same thing though. That's one. See y'all. The O is always 2 minus, but they're... extra So four minus. plus one that has the VA. Redis against other states There's no charge on the compound. If you saw a charge over here, then I'd have to account. but none of these are charters. as the overall charge of the compound. zero. So this just has to add a. the next one. On President Obama's CV to touch on defending drills and coaching, Joe. Bye. you're just adding. of 3. No, because I... We had aocta box    which is why I... Music  to hear. oxygen's ahead of... always.  2. This is. one is doing it. the same too. One thing I... I'm going over. put it in here. years I do what we got. state. It's not. We haven't really done this. 101 I want to be alright So. What if I thought of it that way? I was like, okay, let me just. This is a good place. because this is setting up this whole. so making. Thanks for Wii. VIEW- number of What happened? on this list. like you can go up. Okay. Um Now! D for me. So here's. another What happens when you're looking at thing. Think about. number one It gets confusing. when you start trying to say, well. One thing went from a minus three. to. trying to say was it oxidized or reduced? get confused or if I say from a plus  So always think of the number of lines. And if you're not true. of the direct. functionality right now. to make sure that you know what's being oxidized with. going this way is the other way. positive. losing. And if you're going this way, you're. Chatrying And You're going this way on the truck, so you're... becoming more negative, you're gaining. Awwcccl So if you're... ever uncertain. the random functionality of the reduction the number. Here's the... Thank you. off electrons, Foundation again now We're in the right place, Here's how we're gonna bring. Point here is saying. Well first look at it. Is this valid? to He's missing two. So that's right. for 4. with these in there. pricing... 12. to it. So. One of the things I always...  Oh. If I ever give you any equation and you If you have...  to hit. That means it's. balance. I'll never give you a Wrong balance. and then it... multi- shedding See what I'm saying. So you see how these have the coefficients, that means it's already valid. But a lot of times you'll... have something that and that's for you. This one might have been one of those if I didn't have the balance. This one's a little... Usually that. occurs when you have. onion. This is simply already balanced. show you. How? And as this hat ultimately we're gonna have something that's Unbalanced. when we write the house. order to balance. generally the  Thank you. What is? I'm giving you this balance. We're going to simply. figure out how to do the right. half react  but generally you're gonna get something. unbalanced. and you're gonna have. x reactions in order to get to the balance. because what ultimately balances is Vicky. of it. And they should have and the reduction happens. same number of... then you could balance each other. React. relatively easy We'll do that under. that it can be. And as a result of that, you put it back. together. And now you have the balance. And then... We'll get there a little. because you have.  don't or not. have things under Resist. condition. So that means you have. If you have something under a certain condition... What do you have in the  Hold on. Whoa, that was so Camille. It wasn't Camille. It was only Camille, no.. It was her house. It was M Tom. A because' goo Why doesLE pressure IRobertValue comment about What l would change nothing  we're gonna learn. So that's where we're moving. here. We're just. starting with. for people. already now I want to.  What is the reduction? And what is the option? first thing I have do. figure out what.  on each. thing are. when gained or lost. then I also want to know. how many. total life. Should I come over here and what's... with the oxidation. See you on this.  What about all this? Hi to you. Hello. Plus one. What about on Utah? how many total I've...  So you have a minus six and a... Pawel sprouts After having heard him go on to the next slide, this time he was told to associates about the municipjam the over here. in here.  That one. Oxygens are always... 2 minus of them. of this. minus for that. So I went from zero to. I lost. some stations . So if it lost four electrons... It was what? over here. That's again be a 2 minus and a plus 1. though change. Brain This is going to be 2 minus so they're. Botaniste- So what's the nitrile? plus four So this was a plus. five it goes to forward. So the nitrogen. Gain one elect- It was reduced. and how many of them are there? That's all for now. I hope you enjoyed the video. Subscribe to the channel. I appreciate it. Thank you so much. We'll see you later. Bye! Have a nice night! Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye! Hence the... four electrons that were given off by the one tenth th each nitrogen. an electron. So now if I want to write the half reactant My oxidation half is SN. GOES!  to.  So you think of it as if I. started I certainly want electrons in it. oxidize This is what I start with.  Whatever it does, it now has its... new oxidation  The reduction. I'm starting here. with HNO3. And I now gain electron. So, HNO3 games one so if I  over here I end up with... plus four electrons. goes to NO2 We usually don't have... So. Haha. So here we're just looking, by the way, if you notice what I did here, I went to. individual out. I did not. Go for a sec. I couldn't because there's no NO. real I had to... thing was. because the nitrogen in the nitrate is... thing being reduced. Remember it. traditional. balancing we take if we. Could we keep together the polytome? you would... still do that if you had it on this side. because their family would beat us. same. herThree within. So keep that, but here, there. not on this side. to know. test 10 loses. for electrons. for nitrogen. game. roads he Gloves Snake flows Stited at Juniorstr dismantAmUS So if I asked what was I... drive. the S-end. If you set SN4 plus a already on. be that tool. oteudiont When I'm asking for what oxidize would produce, I'm asking for what's on this side. SN is reduced here, it says nitrogen is reduced. but it would be okay here to say. nitrogen 5-plus. was reduced. say that or you could. See you next time. say. S in. work. because the in the then. Thank you. So I guess. Because this is an element. whatever. the about sure. what it is.  can't knock. here just. hear you. sizes. overnight. reduce you could also Take four nitrogen five. That's more accurate. The confusion there with compound is you really think about. the night. really. in reality. not Remember it. these. are not crochet I had to thank you for Find out.  Just a way to. So follow the... with that. why that's the whole point of this. because I mean, Lexus had to go somewhere and they had to come. And so when you're looking in here. Remember the end. is really not a fight. say. because it's in that.  how connected Twitter is just where the electrons are being. in favor. or closer to the oxygen in those. but they're just. unequally you know. Yeah. not  but the electrons. do go into the night. from the So it's. not really the channel. It's The self is not.  getting the. So that... maybe worth. warning. postages that that you would figure out. They do get more cum.  So looking, it looks like this. same kind of. and Um. I missed this So this does look like that will reflect. most people would agree with that. It doesn't have the aqueous and aqueous. pretty much. more. So we don't know if this is... documentation or whatever else, but it does look like.  which means what? Is it?  It's not available. Okay, so this thing would be a solid. No, but having said that... or any like. Thank you. It's double the placement. yep go when it- here. saying. Um. the reaction is a redox. Mag So what's on? Newcastle reduced record... So that. Mercury here is plus one. B. keeping the NO3 together. the end.  later than i did plus one minus one. Still a plus one. Still a minus one. one. five. Nothing's on. Remember. culture creating everywhere that we have in the nation. move mmm Literally. Right, so if I take this and I throw some salt in... I can put what was it? 30 grams of... NaCl in per every 100 grams of water. The number of water is one gram. So then if I win. 31 grams. 400 it's gonna precipitate. That's what a precipitation. not a transfer of electrons. distinction. between double replace. on the This looks.  So you want to figure out what's off.  reduce and the number of... I think the art in your pronunciation in the reductio.  What me? Why do I say that when I look at this and I say this? Get. not. is That's also true. Yeah.   You're kind of on the right. Fuck it. problem. What have we done? at least in the, what is our objective here? figure out What's the oxidation? Stayed on the... apartment on the left. $200.   We always are looking at each individual one, right? So I know from that turn that the H's are all what? Plus one, so that's it. How many carbons are there?  charge on it. D divided by 3. Thank you. Cyberman Thank you. Z Y I said but I looked. instantly I said oh that I don't know how to make the ox allegiance. for each. What can I do? Multiply out the... So. Ultimately here, do I need to know each- I just want to know what's oxidized, what's reduced. and I want to know how many electrons are trans.  So I could just take the carbons as just. one group. as opposed to trying to make them indivi- if I take it as one group. How would. the charge on all three carbons. What might I say? Minus it. And then if I do it over here, what's... this one carbon. These are my just that's my just or what's this? plus four how many? So if I have a total of plus 12 on here and a total of. need shelter. What? Actually... These are my, I'm sorry, this is minus eight. See what I did when you see my ear on your other attack, right? this that I couldn't separate them individually which I order to do! But if I... I can't do that. if I can then. You'll see. By the way, were the carbons oxidized or reduced if it went from a minus to a plus? Minus eight, four, four. Oh my god! I got a inspir Last stop! OK? Fine. Well, it worked. This one took more than I did before. SuperCityonnaX for your viewers onello X. Yep. H Clearly, it's a new rock. Jan guys. Haifeel, I can also see. 20. total  Thank you. the oxygen with from. zero 2 minus and they're  zero to minus. in. to the... 3 carbon. lose.

I don't think that would be my... only because it's already valid. you can do either. you Carbon, or Fe liquor, carbon. matters today? So the main thing here is how I... Okay. to multiply it That's how we did it in pen. We see that it's then we. at home.  could do that. That's all.  Now you're... you know, these. I'm not saying that, I'm not saying that. So you can say, you can multiply by any number you want. Do the same because this is... 3 for the last thing. 3 in. Well. at night. 12. Yeah. and then your how you're dealing with you could do all that. by the way. because now you're It might. make the first part  but now you're getting mired in back in. you're gonna make Noise because we didn't want. using and I used I got it right. But then he said like. I We did it. That's what we're going to. This is just. So I would. If you can't separate them to a... to it even though. Simple number. and you can also figure it out. Oh boy. That's if it's balanced. So now, and that's because. Now they get into the half. first thing. necessary.\" I have this half reaction so this is oxidized. goes to comfort. silver over. Danes of Lech selfish front. for him sober and then I need to get. number of election images by journals, toibo was a similar number of election details because I'm Burma northeastern It's not easy to remember to lecture at two o'clock but I have been hearing very quick about the governor of hazardoir of hazard and the campaign number ofstab and drowned notilated of possible 20 more... AUDIO OKAY. bottom one.  to. We'll see how it's Multtalking sometime... I mean, if there's something in there. ... to be. here. you have. same number of  They don't.  through. one or the other. equation to get the lowest. common denominator.  That much. do that. can combine... And you also, if you have... waters and other quittily to talk to snotty  other up. cancel whatever you have on both sides and you bring everything. But you. Senator. by getting the. same number. because you... on.  where you have. work. given away than taken. or more taken than given away. And I also want to point out that. really important. window. The reactions don't act. happened. This is. just to wait for us. visualize Step three. They do it simultaneously. This doesn't give up to like frogs and then they just kind of move around and then they go through that thing. That's the whole reason why we say If this is being oxidized. reducing agent So cutekov thing. the electric from Zoom. This thing. is the oxidize an agent because it takes It happens at the same time. They're not. separate. but by separating them we can work. clearly see what's happening. in that. but it does. Now if these did happen... separately, then you can think. Okay, well, where did they go? that If you just... Way to park, it's a here park. electrons. first. then they're really just sitting somewhere. then Do you necessarily need to match this to have a perfect You can start arguing. but they actually have to sign. And then I just. carried out whatever it does. 0 0 fecture 2 minus to Z.   sulfur.   to my... fairly simple. you can take Full React. and go. react could also and go to the.  in the electrolytic. yourselves you're going to. So. Bye. and then the other. thing. you later.  So the idea here is The one that's talking to him for now. So let's get started. You're on your own.people. Got a guest in office today? So once you That's what. So the idea is going to be which one would. 4 to the Kansas other one , company I did. theory. Why does this? go this way. I can reverse this. Thank you. because there's like table for them. We're going to look. We're going to figure out how that. for which one would be. because... I wanted to move. like a battery. to gain energy so I could. do work. and subscribe. I need to know which one of these would prefer to be oxidized. I could flip them. Now this would be the oxidation. This would be the reduction half if I. And my reaction now would be going this way. the arrow going this way. I want to know which one per... refers to be oxidized. which also that means which. And based on that, if I could. I can figure that out, I can now figure out. whether or not one. or not. the one that goes. plus a is the one. prefer. out. put any energy in to make it go. the whole lesson from the last chapter. So that's why we're looking at these. because ultimately I want to find... from the reduction. eventual. that we looked at on the the reduction potential. I want to know which one prefers to be reduced. As a result, I know which one would prefer to be oxidized. And now I know which way I could have a... spontaneous. energy. So that's what we're moving towards. That's why we're doing. but we have to know this and I had. ...  Intro of And then if you took me and I gave you that half reaction, most likely you didn't get it completely right. Haha. I think only one or two people did. That was a hard reaction. We're going to. it again. Now. determine the oxidation... and we. and reduction species in right now. So here we're just ready to have. So what's that? first thing I have. I have to figure out the... will shift bright spend the oxidation numbers. whatever you want. Otherwise I don't know. don't know how to write. So my magnesium is going to be zero here. hydrogen's a plus one, chlorine's a minus one over here, magnesium's a... 2 plus More infection. Hydrogen is now what? is So magnesium goes from zero to two plus. that's going to be oxidized. gives us. electron. and the hydrogen. Each hydrogen goes from a plus 1 to a 0. So each hypo... We didn't talk at the left. So my... reduction happening to elect. does not have a 0 0 went long way now. weak The other thing I want to... I'll be right back. So here you have... The only thing I'll point out here since this is already balanced. pretty straightforward. to.    Oh my god, just... probably  I couldn't let it. one eight Also here, so here's one way to. Or at the Rock Mis compact.  You can get that. me. How many? hydrogen.  to los Westeros the  to hydrating. and then. here. So when you're going. Just one reason why I... plus one to zero. one is only getting. I need. is already there. road. Those are essentially. anomalo. Okay. really just evaluated. Totally Troy.  And then. how much.  question I gave you. Might want one. and I let... No. This is going to. gonna have and you're going to have to make the adjustment. Oh, that. That is the... cars. So in this case, it's easier, but. when you have something like. SN and then SN2. 5 or whatever you have over here You lose. the third. 2SN. and you end up only accounting for Z. Post. one and it's Well, that. IE You get the other. part right and then you're trying to get the lowest common denominator from the wrong total I mean, out of where they're... even though it should be, because if you do think about...  And so I must have, yeah. one must. be getting this And that's also part of the balance. Okay, so now. Here's really the new of Balancing. read out. react.  What we just... there was a review on taking a look at balance. equations. We got. specific figuring out what the...  steps are and then have a right Here. And this is what I was telling you, you want to be able to balance redox reactions that are much better. more complicated that are not already valid. And most of these things are going to have members. I think we're v- now we're going to...  finger. ve balance. for this. because once you... balance. you have. to balance. giving up. the way I draw it lower the Then you write then you can go back. then you This is a There's something. writing the total number of elects.  So. If you have no You could have it under a cinecra- if you have something under a. to the condition. then you could use H. Course is anything. 12. in order to. So. if you're trying to balance. one side. ...  Try to balance. one of the half than you'd rate me.  number of them. And then you just. and then. For basic solutions, you have hydroxide. So here. little bit trickier. Um... So. here. you want. balance You had. Color Meh nothing like the and then I... because that way you get... than the hydraulic Skills Hydrorhome.  So that means if I'm trying to balance. two hours. and I need 4 hydroxide. and you'll see again where So here it says balance. phone options.   Here's what This is not. properly valid. All objected. balance. So just looking at that. Can you balance? chemically. That's it. There's no hydrogen on one side, there's no oxygen. oxygen on the other, how do you balance? It's not a traditional thing where you have everything already in it and you just... So we want to balance. How do we do that? interesting is. And by the way... We want to balance it in the city. in. and then it's an exclusion. My means I have each still under It also means I they. We've got one second session hard. hence why I could use those. about. So the first thing is I gotta figure out the ox.  zero. This would be. My et cetera. Bye. 2plus And here I have... or plus is that What's that?  We gotta do that. zero. to. five to minus zero to plus means that the zinc was what? Oh game actually like when we. So it was. So I'd say zip goes to zip. of electrons I'll be pretty easy. the night.  then I'm going to take the. Hold this. Wait for me. five to a minus. And there's only one thing. one game day. I'm gonna write NO3 minus. plus eight electrons. goes to NH... for a pop. be really easy. The other part. whole thing with it. even though the end is the only thing that's- a bill Where did I get the aid again? Five. means I had to get five elect- to make a zero. And then I needed another. nearly two deliys per minute. get my To call the officers get that have arrived. Now I look at the top half. Is it balanced? One zinc, one zinc. at the bottom. The first thing I'll say is... Here's the. first thing I always they gave up over eaten the elect That's what I care for. the nitrogen. How many is a ballot? One in one. Why did I do that? Why is it? Okay . Okay, they don't want to look. what you were This happened to be N2H. or something like that. And then. I accounted for each one going from five to eight. That means I'd have to put a do hear 2-nitrogen cis number would change That's what you have. at this weapon. That's why the. First thing I look at here is I say... The thing that in this case is being reduced, but also if it was oxidized. Is that thing balanced? Yes. then this stays the same. If it's not, I balance it and whatever number I put there, this... changes. with that number. because that's... only for each night. 3-nitrogens at B times... and three, if I, YA vs G hand. that are actually being transferred. on balance. changes. how I do need to.  one in one. Just put a 2 on the 1. doesn't have So let's say. Let's say this is N2H. or It is no matter. then. I would just. to hear it now. but that also means This now because this was only accounted... the One night.  So all I'm saying is when I do this, the first thing I do is I. the thing that was either in this. case oxidizer What? much I did check out Now I check here, the first thing I check is this thing. That's the first thing I want to balance. is the thing that... in this case was reduced, that's all. first balancing. Colongy. be on- be oxidized. and then whatever.  because in that balancing then. You have to. change this number. yn online. Charlotte So if it's a one-to-one... it stays the same. One to one. stays the same. But if this happened to be a... See? So. and 2H4. I have to then put a 2 here. Which then doubles this because now I'm dealing with tonight.  That will. power Eventually, but not initially. which is why I wanna do that. Now! But these are one to one, so I'm not worried about it. I wouldn't. Whatever would be. whatever the number. If I had double. I have to double whatever that is.  If this was more. to. And this was one I'd have to. change that. too. This was and that was one and a half. change that. Whatever I'm changing. When is the thing that was reduced or octa- for the X. for number 11. So if I had. electron if I have nitrogen night again this was accounted for each night  gained eight electrons. if I had... nitrogen on one side or Were you on one side? I have... double-order triple the other side, which means I double or... triple the number of elects. one guy. to them. to unify. Unemployment for reenactable of What do you want to make? What do you, so you're saying the NH. for your change. to double that. So you want to change that to end. to age  I'm just seeing. if you had...  and So let's do it this way. So in this case, what is the end here? each other. because this would be plus four, so that each end is minus. So now. Instead of going to minus. three. I went plus five to minus. to.  I don't know. So then I now have. 7-1. for each nitrogen, but now, but there are two nitrogen. So now I have to balance this nitrogen with the two. Which means I now have a total of 974  of... And that's really important because that's the sticking point. freshest Thanks for watching, hope you become soon. is not knowing. You said... and see what people do. 1, 2, 3, least or have you been checked by my one on one's guarantee.  of you did. We're... that I gave that same type of problem. And this should have been, let's say, in that case, 14. and you left it as and then try to balance the... to methodist evidence. didn't come each day. YOLI because ultimately this number. has to then match. that number. how we're gonna hold. through. Bye. because it has... Okay, so now. So in this case, it's all right. Look at that first, it's okay, one to one, eight.  thing. Now I say, okay. I have... Over here and not over here. but it's in an acidic solution, so what can I add? to balance out the oxygen. Why did you? I can add I have three oxygen. water has one oxygen. That's why I had... Seems like a blessing . tools over here. That gives me three. oxygen. and We are. Then what do I have left? I said, no, I have. If I had three waters, I also had six hydrogens and for hydrogen. So I just add 10 inches. buses on this side. That's balancing it. Then I go ahead and combine, since these are right numbers here, this is... This is to. They have to have the lowest common denominator, which would just be 8. If I multiply this whole thing by 4... And then I. in here my fans have a song on them A song to theTrack absolutely What is your favorite part of my supplyapharie? I hate Ken Contermott he's trying to like you know Yeah Oh I'm going to hear it I'm sure your'e in the Essential t's everything down. So here in this one I'm now going to balance. the oxygen's... by hand. salsa related Shah did a great potential Israel we love to hear from a single FA program that builds out highvelts in American utilities County for the issues a little bit transformations have brought to vans as well as a sl Slerer event Sharp ie walls for Deputy Secretaryzin balance out. Riosa. gives me you 10 ages. Scanning! Now I have a balance and 0.3 minus. some reason now  now. thearshavah. half is already balanced. Now the redo-  and ballot. Now I have... clips ADC The whole point of this. And once I do that... Then I... combined. So the lowest common denominator. which means I multi... one by  work Mm Babers Drop natural business the Cecil getting a lap. I'll be elected. bring everything else. now.  We might. Virgin mission closing It's weird. I don't know. Is there a way we can tell from this? Is there a note that we can know? Oh, so we can see that night. You have this in... That is like assure the but you also. now you know. how many. Oh. Is this like a real Miami?  Thank you. Thank you. on that. So, yeah, see the... problem with. You couldn't do that. I don't you just real fu- but then you have. You can't do that. So if I just. So the question was... is not how it acts. is where I think that comes. Yeah. So this is actually, remember these are. equivalent. papers. If you want to put.  real buses here. then you have to include those.  garden and do any suggestions that we have to keep track while the garden Press and this would just be 13. in some other type. problem. I would argue. then they do this The only thing that's... if you wanted to double check for you just. going to make. You did one thing wrong and the other thing wrong. So then you get a false census. Oh, it got it right because the charges checked out. No, you just did something else wrong with it so if the charges do, check out. But if you did this and they were wrong, that could tell you. but I don't know how that... So that's balancing with the. under acidic use. Now let's look at her vase. So here to balance the options.  2-hydroxide. to the offices. side of them. with water. you. about it. trying to balance out.  And then if you're trying to balance out the hydrogen. Then you just add water to the deficient side and one hydroxide to the... that makes sense? See you soon. that one. So. If you want to add... hydrogen you just add hydro- You add water to one side and... the other. you want it. Lolliwald! I draw That's because... If you're trying to... balance on oxygen. So let's say I have A B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B the next here. I put two hydroxides over here. That gives me two oxygens. to balance out one of those lines. It leaves me with one octa- eyes by the water. And then if I'm just trying to balance out hydrogen. that I just put it each two So let's say I have one extra high. here. Then I put an H2 over here. So I get two H's in one O. And then I put the hydroxide on that side to get rid of one of those. So if I had three extra hydrogens over here. I put three H2Os over here. three hydroxide. reason though that Thank you. What I generally do, you're gonna get a question, but you have to do this.  overreacting. on you. In case you want to see more of our exclusive images, please leave a comment. too that out. Amanda. I know the acidic one is easier. We'll see you next time. But this is not that. Really. if it was at least.  So if I look at this. Now if you look at this Clearly there are no coefficients. So I'm looking to balance. Can I just look at this and. Weird, right? It's not easy. So one way to balance it. do it under a. to the core base. and we're gonna do this one on your face. So the first thing I have to do, by the way, how do I know this? Remember the other one. Give it a re- So. I want to balance this thing out. They say do another basic condition. So the first thing I gotta do is I gotta figure out that. Night, be right! I have What do you think about, okay, so. No! Sometimes the. hydrogen. or the octane. can be the thing. You no real And a lot of times they were not. and they're usually not. All you have to do is say, do I have... 02 L.H. Are they in their elemental form? If I don't, you don't, those are not going to be changing in less. they're in their elemental form. So O2 and H2O2 too, right? O2H. Those are their elemental form, which means they're zero and zero. Keep Holy! that these are going to be oxidized or reduced as if you have one of these. on one side or the other. made me work. Because in... these compounds, they're all see how all in the compound? What is it every time in the... I know the. in this not reduce I'm bright. I would have known for sure. If I had O2 on one side... then I would have had it. or read. Do you see what I'm saying? so you can automatically ignore oxygen. hydrogen and hydrogen. here. if you don't have them in their elemental form because they're all in less than courses change would be a... That's the only thing I have.  either minded  Now. If you have it though, you can. 99.9% of the time. hyperpigetor ox thing be an oxides reduce because you have elemental form on one side or the other. When it's in the compound, they're always... one in my to. So that. one way to quickly evaluate. and there's no hydrogen. So oxygen. is not the thing we not... reduce going to be minus. at all. No.  zero to my So that means the other things that I'm looking at, manganese and sulfur. Pretty straightforward. So I already know the two things that I'm trying to evaluate. Megan Eason here is gonna be, I have minus eight. so much. There's one of them. I just got to be a plus. 7. And here I have my... word that's going to be minus eight and one of the minus terms. So magazine. 7 gives me a minus. So I have M in.  and oh oh. Oh, whoa. and I have a negative  already. I have 2 minus mind 2 minus to my head. That's it. total of 8 minus. Deep minus. This has to be a 7. eight minus. give me a minute. Oh. Oh. This is a minus charge. So the overall compound is a negative one. So I already know I have a total of eight minus wrapped up in the O's. What are those people? One of those minuses are sitting here. So that means I have seven left. I have.  Yes, I thought that too. like this. Thank you.  No, no, that's just a charge. That's a charge. charge. in the compound. Yeah, yeah. That's a polyatomic ion. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's a polyatomic ion. to the overall charge. of the manganese and the four oxygens is a minus. one. ocalizer Mine is from the oxygen, I need a plus. seven in order to have And so for being a. because this is a minus. There. two of them. So that's going to be a. In here, this has got to be your look. to that. You hear there's no charge. And then here I have what.  That would be the. Then I say I went for plus seven. termaster one manganese. another main. about that.   The more negative. plus four to plus six. I'm getting rid of. oo So the ox... Are you? going to be. and I have. WENDY ST clipper one I'll write the article. nation have. two minus To minus. and then we'll... here in the reduction I had. and then... minus real  Where is? realityina And then I had. the ring. the culmination of the  being induced. to write it. bringing the whole thing up.  Just like. even though... So. thing that's gaining the election. giving up the electrons. It still has to be written in whatever. ... because that's... Hello  Yes. Adam. or gave up. whatever. ... Whoa! No, because of Remember the. previous one I think it was  91°, So it wasn't. Easy. In this case... These are actually. connected to the op-  You have to bring them down. I'll point that out again. Notice the Okay, so the first one here. I can see whoops. balance. first thing I look at So for those one in one. balance. The second thing is. three here and one. were there. So I need one more on this. So when I balance out. under basic solution. What do I need? 19. two hydroxides on one side. fine. when it. 201. hydRAY amb sophomore over here. one.  I'm not worried about the electronic. That's why to. Only now, Balancinha. So the first thing I said...  You know? thing I look at. One. One. We have a lot. If this happened to be a 2 here, as- 204 then I'd have to put a two here. and I have to double this. because I was... saying that each One was. or left. So that's why I'm saying I... I wanted me.  So what's our deal then? One in one. Now I go to the other things. case the other thing is this here. three. or What for? doing on this if I'm in it. condition. I simply put an H. over here And then I put.  husses over here. about but in a basic condition. I put. two hydroxides over. here. and to balance out, I'm gonna put one each. over here. the only difference. between the silicon base and the silicon. one's not that much harder than the other. depends on the environment. and then over here.

So in this case... case here I only needed one Sorry, bye. hydroxide. with water. Here I am. too or hydrants. if you wanted. I can't be after one that job. I'll have luck answering that and one more. So show me what you want to do. So which one you want to talk about, which one you want to do? So let me write that up. first thing we're good with. y'all. check out on Thank you. So now. I want to add. to a hydro. 2 up. What happened? So for each of... hydroxyl. That's a total of four major updates. So then I pour. always So now I have. So now I have it. It's type of toilet product. Son, tracking How you not told that he is Mickey Oh In sexual prestige Getting and 4, 5. So for every. I put it.  Here I have... to it. Why can't... Why can't we say?   that you're only getting... to hydroxide. There's a beach high beach. hydroxide. gives you one.  Yes, and that's what we need. We're hearing. So will TDAM and our audience, taxes free. hydroxyl Who would say that they would ban the hopefully and Safari event we will require ratings So how many? How many options do I have here? have a nice priced offer safe mouth uh... yeah uh... yeah this So what happens if we only.  Wow. you want to add? What do you want to add? Tell me what you want to add in the latter.    so far we. hydroxides you need one water. How many oxygens? Why are the maps on that? You're watching.  over. every you need. I need two hydra. So I want to add one. What? here. I need. to station 33 portbound. There are 2 Force Bra Horns. There are 2 Hydrons. because I add one eight. over here. sealed for Web LinkedIn. every to hydroxide. There are the two hydrodists. but I only get one option. So I need to add. two more if I need. to the total. I need to add. more hydroxyl. to one. because water. Out of the two hydroxides, you're only getting one. See two hydroxyl, let me separate this. even more.  Goodbye. One hydroxide. 2 hydro. and one. Thank you. too well. two ages. one oh  only Dean one over. Oh, because it... on the left. also being born.  That's why he... two hydroxide. every game of it on. So if I'm missing too much.  I need. One more hydroxide. sides. Two for one. two for the other. and 2H. two hours. This balances, this one, that balances up. Does that help? because of every... with everyone that you're gonna go up on that. time! And that's the whole point of the basic conditions. You only have hydroxide and water to work with. were in acidic conditions and now you have eat Krausden water which different. easier because he... doesn't. come twice. itself. because that way you just the. Plus, simpler. Here I have it.  coming with a high. and I need the balance. So that's why. here right. 40 or hydroxide. and over here I put two waters to balance. and  hydro Asya, come inside. Kevin has. when water. There's no. going east. here. Once again, now we just. not Celt or hydroxide. to the right. ree of the left. balance up. That's awesome. If they work. hydrogen. do that. And then I go to the top. there are. or let's just say they're only hydrogen. no no no then I would simply. Um, 20. to one side. getting one piece.  In this case, this is... See him again. now. Here are the actual half-grams. I have this thing here. and So now in order to combine them. I have. to get the lowest. common denominator. of the election. and three the lowest I'm a denominator. 5-2 I have to move. This whole thing by 3. This whole thing bites. too. So bye. this becomes 3 The recall technology ducks beyond the green to test heightened mind, tele Stru diming to reach a higher three. then bye. this becomes you to eight.  there to combine them I need they're not right in the house.  still find a way to get these.
